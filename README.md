## :x: Problem
Ex-prisoners often struggle to access the crucial legal information they need for post-release cases, creating a significant challenge in their efforts to reintegrate into society successfully. This lack of readily available, comprehensible resources hinders their ability to navigate the complex legal landscape and make informed decisions, perpetuating a cycle of uncertainty and reoffending.
